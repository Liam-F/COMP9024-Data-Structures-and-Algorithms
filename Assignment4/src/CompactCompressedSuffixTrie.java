	 * Creates a compact representation of the compressed suffix trie from an input text file f that stores a DNA sequence using Ukkonen's algorithm.
	 * Also use Edge-label compression.

	 * 
	 * Rules:
	 * Let B = S[j...i] be a suffix of S[1...i].
	 * Rule 1: In phase i+1 if B ends at a leaf then add S[i+1] at 
	 * the end.
	 * Rule 2: In phase i+1 if B ends in the middle of an edge and the next character is
	 * not S[i+1] -> a new leaf edge starting from the end of B with label S[i+1] is created.
	 * Rule 3: In phase i+1 if B ends in the middle of an edge and next character is
	 * S[i+1] then do nothing since BS[i+1] already in trie.
	 * 
	 * To speed up, 3 tricks are used:
	 * Trick 1: When walking down from node s(v) to leaf we directly skip to the end of the edge 
	 * if the number of characters on the edge is less than the number of characters we need to traverse.
	 * If number of characters on the edge is more than the number of characters 
	 * we need to travel, we directly skip to the last character on that edge.
	 * Trick 2: Stop phase as soon as rule 3 applies since all further extensions are already present in tree implicitly.
	 * Trick 3: Use a global end.
	 *  
	 * @throws FileNotFoundException
	 * 
	 * Time complexity analysis:
	 * The reading from the file and conversions takes linear time.
	 * 
	 * We automatically update all leaves using the global end, so it takes constant time.
	 * 
	 * remS states how many additional inserts that has to be made, it's bounded by the global end (maximum number of suffixes left).
	 * 
	 * Each insert takes constant time since the active variables tells us where to insert and the number characters in the DNA-alphabet is constant.
	 * 
	 * After insertions remS is decremented and we follow the chain suffix links or go/stay to root 
	 * (If we are at root already, we modify the active point) so it takes constant time.
	 * As we follow down the chain of suffix links to make the remaining inserts, 
	 * active_length can only decrease, and the number of adjustments can't be larger than active_length. 
	 * Since active_length<=remS, the total sum of increments ever made to remainder for of the entire process is O(n) 
	 * and so the number of active point adjustments is also bounded by O(n).
	 *
	 * The indexing of the trie takes linear time.
	 * 
	 * So the total worst case time-complexity of the constructor is O(n) where n is the size of the input DNA sequence.
